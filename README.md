Nucleus CMS UTF-8 Conversion
===================

This attempts to convert your legacy Nucleus database tables to UTF-8. Only the Nucleus tables in the database will be converted. There are a few Nucleus tables that do not have primary keys and thus cannot be converted by this program.

While I have tested this quite a bit on my own Nucleus install, it should be considered *experimental* and you should absolutely update your entire database before trying it.
