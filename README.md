# Nucleus CMS UTF-8 Conversion

This attempts to convert your legacy [Nucleus CMS](http://nucleuscms.org) database tables to UTF-8. Only the Nucleus tables in the database will be converted.

## Installing and Using

1. Back up your database.
2. Upload the utf8/ directory to your nucleus/ directory.
3. You backed up your database, right?
4. In your browser, open the URL to the nucleus/utf8/ directory on your site. E.g. example.com/nucleus/utf8/
5. Click the link on that page to initiate the conversion process.

## Notes

While I have tested this quite a bit on my own Nucleus install, it should be considered *experimental* and you should **absolutely** back up your entire Nucleus database before trying it.

Depending on the size of your database, the conversion process could take quite some time.

There are a few Nucleus tables that do not have primary keys and thus cannot be converted by this program. Also, if a table has no fields with a character data type, it will be skipped.

Many thanks to Sebasti√°n Grignoli for his [forceutf8](https://github.com/neitanod/forceutf8) package. Without it this would not work and I probably would have never finished it on my own.
